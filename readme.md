**Reporting to me**
* We’re partners. We have open, honest discussions. We should offer [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach/).
* You don’t need to always have the answers - we can create value together.
* 1:1’s. We’ll meet weekly at first and adjust the cadence as appropriate after a few months. The primary purpose of these sessions will be on professional development, bi-directional feedback, and reviewing performance. Updates on tactical activities can wait. Tell me concerns as they come. Escalate impediments ASAP.
* Myers Briggs:
> INTPs have a very tolerant and flexible style, characterized by an openness to logical suggestions and relative freedom for their subordinates. But this freedom comes at a cost – INTP managers have very high standards, and they expect others to grasp their insights instantly, and to provide their own in equal measure.

**As a Scrum PM**
* My main jobs on the team are helping to bring context and prioritize, with my main goal being maximize the ROI of the team and ultimately the organization.
* I will lean towards bringing forward problems and asking for solutions.
* I am a leader-servant, so please let me know how I can make your life easier and how I can boost your productivity.

**Interacting with me**
* I thrive on timely and open feedback. Don’t be afraid to tell me what’s on your mind.
* My schedule can be very tight, so don't be afriad to work asynchronously. DM me on Slack, send me a video recording with Loom, show me the Work-In-Progress.
* I weave my work in with my life, so you'll likely get communications from me at odd hours. Don't feel pressured to respond immediately outside typical office hours for non-urgent issues.
* Myers Briggs:
> Mingling, chitchat, drinks after work – these make INTPs want to work alone, not get up in the morning. Despite this distance, people with the INTP personality type are unusually good at developing insightful and unbiased interpretations of others’ motivations, though sometimes they overthink it, becoming unnecessarily suspicious of others’ goals.
INTP personalities prefer to work alone, but at the same time they despise "grunt-work". Their focus on conceiving new and exciting ideas and ignoring the details of execution means that INTPs need someone alongside to keep things in order and actually put into practice their often unrefined ideas.
