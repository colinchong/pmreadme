**Reporting to me**
* We’re partners. We have open, honest discussions. We should offer each other [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach/).
* Think of me as an investor and yourself as an entrepeneur. We align on creating value. I support and enable you. You own your business.
* You don’t need to always have the answers - let's collaborate and explore together. We share in outcomes.
* 1:1’s. We’ll meet weekly at first and adjust the cadence as appropriate after a few months. The primary purpose of these sessions will be on professional development, bi-directional feedback, and reviewing performance. Updates on tactical activities can wait. Tell me concerns as they come. Escalate impediments ASAP.
> Come prepared to our 1:1s with information about your priorities and any topics you'd like to discuss. It can be useful to track these in a shared doc to ensure the time is well spent on the most important items.

**As a Scrum PM**
* My main jobs on the team are helping to bring context and prioritize, with my main goal being maximize the ROI of the team and ultimately the organization.
* I will lean towards bringing forward problems and asking for solutions.
* I am a leader-servant, so please let me know how I can make your life easier and how I can boost your productivity.

**Interacting with me**
* I thrive on timely and open feedback. Don’t be afraid to tell me what’s on your mind.
* My schedule can be very tight, so don't be afriad to work asynchronously. DM me on Slack, send me a video recording with Loom, show me the Work-In-Progress.
* I weave my work in with my life, so you'll likely get communications from me at odd hours. Don't feel pressured to respond immediately outside typical office hours for non-urgent issues.
